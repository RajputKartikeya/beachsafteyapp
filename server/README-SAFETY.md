# Beach Safety Feature Implementation

This document explains how the automatic beach safety determination system works in the Beach Safety App.

## Overview

The Beach Safety App now includes automatic safety determination for beaches based on wave height and ocean current conditions. When these conditions are updated, the system automatically recalculates whether a beach is safe for visitors.

## Safety Criteria

A beach is considered unsafe if either of these conditions is met:

- Wave height is greater than or equal to 1.5 meters
- Ocean currents are described as "Strong" or "Moderate to Strong"

## Implementation Details

### Automatic Safety Updates

When beach data is updated via the API (particularly wave height or ocean current data), the system:

1. Retrieves the current beach data
2. Evaluates the new safety status based on the updated conditions
3. Updates the `isSafe` property automatically
4. Saves the updated data to the Firebase Realtime Database

### Database Synchronization

A special endpoint `/api/admin/sync-check` is available to verify and repair the synchronization between the API and database. This endpoint:

1. Retrieves all beaches from the database
2. Recalculates each beach's safety status based on current wave height and current data
3. Updates any beach where the calculated safety status doesn't match the stored value
4. Returns a report of checked and updated beaches

## API Usage Examples

### Update Beach Conditions

The system will automatically update the safety status when you update wave height or ocean currents.

```
PUT /api/beaches/3
{
  "waveHeight": 2.1,
  "oceanCurrents": "Strong"
}
```

Response will include the updated beach with its new safety status (automatically set to `false` in this example).

### Check Database Synchronization

```
GET /api/admin/sync-check
```

This will check all beaches in the database and update any incorrect safety values.

## Client Implementation

On the client side, make sure to refresh beach data after updates to display the latest safety status to users.

## Safety Threshold Adjustment

To adjust the safety thresholds, modify the `evaluateBeachSafety` function in `index.js`:

```javascript
function evaluateBeachSafety(waveHeight, oceanCurrents) {
  // Adjust these thresholds as needed
  const dangerousWaveHeight = 1.5;
  const dangerousCurrents = ["Strong", "Moderate to Strong"];

  if (waveHeight >= dangerousWaveHeight) return false;
  if (dangerousCurrents.some((current) => oceanCurrents.includes(current)))
    return false;

  return true;
}
```
